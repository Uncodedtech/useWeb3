The UNI community is at the heart of everything we do and it is thanks to you all that we have gotten this far. The goal for UGP is to ensure sustainable growth for the passionate ecosystem that has dedicated so much time and effort in growing the protocol.

Our mission is to continue cultivating this enthusiasm and talent, so to start, UGP seeks to support focused areas accomplishing the following:

- **Usability** - improving the user experience
- **Community** - growing the ecosystem
- **Tooling** - improving the developer experience

Support is available for both individuals and teams attempting to provide innovative solutions, tackling problems, or contributing to existing tools for the three focused areas above.
