The EVM is a central part of Ethereum. It is Ethereumâ€™s execution engine, responsible for executing Ethereum programs, also called Smart Contracts.

In this tutorial we are going to build the EVM from scratch. However, this is not a reference implementation. I will omit implementation details if I believe they are not necessary for understanding how the EVM works. This is about learning the core concepts of the EVM from first principles.

That is why I want to call it a mini-EVM. A working but simplified version of the real thing. A virtual machine that takes in an Ethereum program as input and executes that.
